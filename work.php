      <h2>College Infrastructure Maintenance</h2>
      <p>Our project aims to improve the maintenance of college infrastructure by providing an efficient complaint system. We address various issues related to infrastructure problems, such as faulty equipment, damaged facilities, or cleanliness concerns.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>User Registers a Complaint:</li>
        <p>Users, including students and faculty members, can register a complaint regarding any infrastructure issue they encounter. They can provide details of the problem, such as location and description.</p>
        <li>Admin Receives the Complaint:</li>
        <p>Once a complaint is submitted, the admin receives the complaint notification and can review the details provided by the user.</p>
        <li>Admin Addresses the Complaint:</li>
        <p>The admin takes necessary actions to resolve the reported issue. This may involve assigning maintenance staff, scheduling repairs, or coordinating with relevant departments.</p>
        <li>User Can Track Complaint Status:</li>
        <p>Users can track the status of their complaints through our system. They can see updates, such as when the complaint is being processed, under review, or resolved.</p>
      </ol>
